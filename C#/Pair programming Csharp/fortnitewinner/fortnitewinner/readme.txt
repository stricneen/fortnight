BJSS Coding Test: Time 45 minutes (approx.)

At a recent social event, BJSS teams competed in a Fortnite challenge. 

Each team was scored by how many kills they achieved versus how many they received. 
The team with the biggest difference received a small prize – and bragging rights.

Write a program to work out and show the name of the team who won our competition.

Your starting point is a project which includes a data file, some utility classes and a failing test. 
Along with your pair, get as far as you can, using good engineering practices to build out your solution.
